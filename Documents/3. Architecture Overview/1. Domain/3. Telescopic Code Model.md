#### Validation
A piece of code to test data against a defined set of conditions and rules to decide whether it is valid or not. In case of any violation, it should describe why the data is invalid and which rule it is against.
#### Ensure
Double check internal data to ensure not invariant is violated.
#### Mutation
1. Run [[3. Telescopic Code Model#Validation]]
2. Mutate Internal Data
3. Run [[3. Telescopic Code Model#Ensure]]
no checks or branching is done inside mutate blocks.
in C# they are equivalent to property setters but could be coded separately.
#### Transition
Moving from on state in the [[3. Controller Datapath Model#1. Controllers With an FSM|FSM]] of entity to another by mutating internal state.
This could also be assigned to a execution context if needed to handle technical state required by application.
#### Derive
The [[3. Controller Datapath Model#2. Controllers Without an FSM|No FSM]] resolution of an state from internal and external data, and state machines.
#### Decision
Decide which transitions, flow, or mutations to perform based on the internal or derived states.
#### Flow
Chain decisions together. The start node.
